    <h4>Reduce Your Mobile Data Usage</h4>
    <p>Take a look at your mobile data usage. Most of it's Rdio, and most of it is from streaming the same few songs over and over again. Why not cache them on your phone?</p>

    <h4>Don't Be Without Good Music</h4>
    <p>Life's to short to spend it in silence. Let Sink manage which songs sync and you'll be sure to have kick ass tunes, even in the middle of nowhere</p>
